## Description
Considering the tight schedule that people and businesses have, the concept of this daily scheduler app was developed with the follwing user story in mind:
 - AS AN employee with a busy schedule
 - I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
 - SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
    - GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
    - WHEN I open the planner
    - THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    - WHEN I scroll down
    - THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
    - WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
    - THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
    - WHEN I click into a time block
    - THEN I can enter an event
    - WHEN I click the save button for that time block
    - THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
    - WHEN I refresh the page
    - THEN the saved events persist
